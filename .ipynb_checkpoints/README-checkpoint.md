# RClass - Classification by Rational Approximation
![eqn](./assets/images/imp_eqn.png)

## Project Overview
This project is a group effort aimed at developing a unique classification model based on rational functions. Unlike traditional classifiers (such as neural networks or logistic regression), our approach explores the use of rational function approximations for classifying images. For this project, we are using the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits as a test case to evaluate the effectiveness of this novel classifier.

## Project Goals
- Implement a classification model that uses rational functions for image classification.
- Train the model on the MNIST dataset, a popular dataset consisting of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9).
- Analyze the performance of rational function-based classification, including accuracy and computational efficiency.
- Document findings, challenges, and insights for potential future applications and improvements.
